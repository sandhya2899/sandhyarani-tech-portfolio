# UX & Product Glossary

## 📘 Introduction

Whether you're building an app, refining a user flow, or writing product documentation, understanding UX and product terminology is essential for creating meaningful and effective digital experiences.

This glossary serves as a quick-reference guide to the most commonly used terms in UX and product development — the ones that tend to show up in meetings, product specs, and the occasional Slack thread that spirals into a debate about whether a modal should really *ever* have more than two buttons.

You don’t need to be a designer or developer to benefit — you just need to work with them.

TL;DR: If you’re building stuff for humans (aka users), these terms are your new besties.

## 📚 Glossary Entries

### 1. User Persona  
**Definition:**  
A fictional profile representing a segment of users, created using data from research.

**Why It Matters:**  
It helps teams build empathy and design for real user behaviors and goals.

**Example:**  
Spotify might create a persona like “Amrita, 27, freelance designer who uses Spotify to maintain focus during work.” This informs features like focus playlists and ad-free options.

---

### 2. User Journey  
**Definition:**  
The complete series of steps a user takes to accomplish a goal in a product.

**Why It Matters:**  
Helps identify friction points and improve overall user experience.

**Example:**  
Swiggy’s user journey starts at "open the app" and ends at "receive food." If many users drop off at the payment screen, the design team may simplify the checkout process.

---

### 3. Wireframe  
**Definition:**  
A low-fidelity layout of a page showing basic structure and elements.

**Why It Matters:**  
Helps stakeholders quickly align on screen layout before investing in visuals.

**Example:**  
When Zomato designs a new restaurant page, they begin with wireframes to finalize the placement of reviews, images, and menu sections.

---

### 4. Prototype  
**Definition:**  
An interactive simulation of a product used to test functionality and design.

**Why It Matters:**  
Enables user feedback before building the final product.

**Example:**  
Razorpay might use a clickable prototype to test how easily business users can configure payment links, helping refine the UI before release.

---

### 5. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
**Definition:**  
A version of a product with just enough features to be usable and tested by early adopters.

**Why It Matters:**  
Reduces time to market and helps validate core product value.

**Example:**  
Airbnb’s MVP let users book rooms from locals — no map view, filters, or payments — proving the concept before scaling.

---

### 6. A/B Testing  
**Definition:**  
An experiment comparing two versions of a feature to see which performs better.

**Why It Matters:**  
Leads to data-driven design decisions that increase engagement or revenue.

**Example:**  
Netflix might test two cover images for a movie — one showing the lead actor, another showing action — to see which gets more views.

---

### 7. Accessibility (a11y)  
**Definition:**  
Designing products so people with disabilities can use them effectively.

**Why It Matters:**  
Improves usability for all users and ensures legal compliance.

**Example:**  
LinkedIn’s accessibility features — like keyboard navigation and screen reader support — allow visually impaired professionals to apply for jobs and connect with peers.

---

### 8. Information Architecture (IA)  
**Definition:**  
The structure and labeling of content in a product to make it easy to find and use.

**Why It Matters:**  
Reduces confusion and improves navigation.

**Example:**  
Amazon’s category structure — from "Electronics" to "Mobile Accessories" — is a product of strong IA that helps users find items faster.

---

### 9. Onboarding  
**Definition:**  
The process of guiding new users to their first success with your product.

**Why It Matters:**  
Reduces churn and increases product adoption.

**Example:**  
Notion uses tooltips, sample content, and a checklist to help new users create and organize pages quickly during onboarding.

---

### 10. Conversion Rate  
**Definition:**  
The percentage of users who complete a desired action, like signing up or making a purchase.

**Why It Matters:**  
A key metric for product and marketing success.

**Example:**  
If Flipkart changes the color of the “Buy Now” button and sees a 10% increase in purchases, it means the new version boosted conversion rate.
